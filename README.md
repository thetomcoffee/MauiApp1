# MauiApp1

Playing around with the starter .NET MAUI solution created by Visual Studio 2022.  

Using this as a guide: 
[.NET MAUI for Beginners](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/dotnet-maui-for-beginners/)
and 
[Build your first app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app?pivots=devices-windows&tabs=vswin) 
which is part of
[.NET Multi-platform App UI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/)
This last link has comprehensive documentation on .NET MAUI.

Updated default app to show current date and time when button is clicked.
